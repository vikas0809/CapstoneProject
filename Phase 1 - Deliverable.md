Phase 1 : Deliverables

## Finalize a project idea including a dataset
-  Car Insurance Claim Prediction
-  The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

## Create a mockup of your machine learning models e.g. what will be the inputs and what will be the outputs
## Create an outline/mockup of what will your final dashboard present?
## Perform Data Exploration on your dataset in Python
- File: data_exploration
- How many rows and columns are there in the dataset
- View basic statistics of the data
- Are there any null values
- What are the data types for each column
- Plot histograms for all numerical values
- Visualize the relationship between all numerical columns (using scatter plots)
- Calculate the correlation 
- Plot boxplots for all numeric columns
