## Finalize a project idea including a dataset
-  Car Insurance Claim Prediction
-  The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

## Create an ER diagram of your database (does not apply to us)
## Create a mockup of your machine learning models e.g. what will be the inputs and what will be the outputs
## Create an outline/mockup of what will your final dashboard present?
## Perform Data Exploration on your dataset in Python
## Continue using Github to merge all you produce into branches and main repo
