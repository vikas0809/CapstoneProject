Phase 1 : Deliverables

## Finalize a project idea including a dataset
-  Car Insurance Claim Prediction
-  The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

## Create a mockup of your machine learning models e.g. what will be the inputs and what will be the outputs
## Create an outline/mockup of what will your final dashboard present?
## Perform Data Exploration on your dataset in Python
- File: data_exploration </br>
For data exploration, we performed the following steps:
- Load the cvs file into a data frame
- Get the number of rows and columns in the dataset
   - there are 58592 rows and 44 columns
- Viewing the first 5 rows of the data
- View basic statistics of the data
- Get information about the columns to see the data type for each column and if there are any null values
- Plot histograms for all numerical values
- Visualize the relationship between all numerical columns (using scatter plots)
- Get the correlation matrix to see if there is any correlation between variables
- Plot boxplots for all numeric columns
